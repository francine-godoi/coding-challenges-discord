# File Filter challenge

You are nervous stepping into our new Tech With Tim Building as you are applying for the interview 
you head to the waiting room getting more and more nervous you hear your name being called out
so you head into the room just to be met with our bot expert face to face (aka sylte).
He gave you one task and a week to complete it.


Task

from discord.ext import commands

def setup(bot):
    bot.add_cog(FileFilter(bot=bot))

class FileFilter(commands.Cog):
    """Adds functionality to filter out sertant files based on their extention"""
    def __init__(self, bot: commands.Bot):
        self.bot = bot
        self.accepted_extentions: List[str] = []

    @commands.Cog.listener()
    async def on_message(self, message: discord.Message):
        ... # Add your code here.


Using this format, check if the message has any attachments, if the attachments file extention is not in our list of valid extention delete the message and let the user know you cant post files of that filetype!
Ignore any messages from staff and bots

A list of allowed file extensions is available as self.accepted_extentions as seen in the code

Grading
Your code needs to have or needs to account for:

- Functionality
- Order of code
- Readability 

a message.attachments is a list of attachments .. example :

# when u print message.attachments
[<Attachment id=725065644986597456 filename='New_Text_Document.txt'
 url='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/705785243101036605/725065644986597456/New_Text_Document.txt'>]
