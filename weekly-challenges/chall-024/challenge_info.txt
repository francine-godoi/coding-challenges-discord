Challenge 24: Count Black Cells
Imagine a white grid of n rows and m columns divided into two parts by a diagonal line running from the upper left to the lower right corner. Now let's paint the grid in two colors according to the following rules:

A cell is painted black if it has at least one point in common with the diagonal;
Otherwise, a cell is painted white.
Count the number of cells painted black.
Example:

>>> solution(3, 4)
6

Because there are 6 cells that have at least one common point with the diagonal and therefore are painted black (see image below).
